df = pd.read_csv("Salary_Data.csv")
# print(df.head())

# print(df.describe()) --> gives basic stat for the dataset
# now this is a linear regression problem, simple line graph equation is
# y = mx + c --> here m is slope of graph(line) and c is the constant, y is output (this o/p is to be predicted using the linear regression)
